# GraphQL

## A query language for your API

<Notes>
  I think of graphql as a similar tool as
  typescript. It allows us to encode information
  about our code (possibilities, constraints) in a
  way that the computer understands. By spending
  more time up front defining our application's
  behavior, we get a bunch of cool stuff.

## GraphQL is a specification, not an implementation

<Notes>
  The example today will be in Javascript, but
  there are graphql implementations in most
  languages. Javascript is the most common though.

# Get exactly what you ask for ðŸ¤ª

---

<FullScreenCode>

```graphql
# Query
query {
  user {
    name
    email
  }
}

# Response
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "name": "Ryan",
      "email": "ryan@mytrellis.com"
    }
  }
}
```

</FullScreenCode>

<Notes>
  A simple query for a user. Notice how the shape
  of the response matches the shape of the request
</Notes>

# Get exactly what you ask for ðŸ¤ª

---

```graphql
# Query
query {
  user {
    name
    email
  }
}
```

```json
// Response
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "name": "Ryan",
      "email": "ryan@mytrellis.com"
    }
  }
}
```

<Notes>
  A simple query for a user. Above is the query
  that a client would send (via HTTP), and below
  is the response. Notice how the shape of the
  response matches the shape of the request. If
  you left out one of those fields in the request,
  it would not be sent in the response.

# Types

---

### Example User type

```graphql
type User {
  name: String
  email: String
  age: Int
}
```

<Notes>
  When you build a graphql server, you need to
  define all of the types. This allows your server
  to verify that the types it is sending down
  matches what you expect. It also allows for some
  really great tooling (introspection, caching,
  type generation)

# The life of a request

<Notes>
  Implement the name resolver:
  ```
  type Query {
    name: String
  }
  ```
  Explain:
  index.js
  what is a resolver
  arguments
  root
  context briefly
  ask what questions are there
</Notes>

---

## Each field has it's own resolver

<Notes>
  This is a really powerful concept, and this is
  where the Graph in graphql comes from. We will
  come back to this later, but let's look at how
  to implement a more complex set of resolvers
  ```
  type Query {
    user: User
  }
  type User {
    name: String
    age: Int
  }
  ```
  Explain:
  A field that returns a User should always return a "User"
  A field on a User will always be passed a "User"
  What gets passed can change based on args
  Can be loosely coupled with underlying data (eg dogyears)
</Notes>

---

## Real example

<Notes>
  Let's use a fake database to explore what a real server would look like
  ```
  type Query {
    user(id: Int): User
    users: [User]
  }
  type User {
    name: String
    age: Int
  }
  ```
</Notes>

---

## Resolver-ception

<Notes>
  Because each resolver is independent, you can
  resolve relationships very easily. With a rest
  API, you might return a list of friend ids. But
  with graphql, we can return a list of Users
  directly!  No additional code needed to perform
  deep queries.
  ```
  type Query {
    user(id: Int): User
    users: [User]
  }
  type User {
    name: String
    age: Int
    friends: [User]
  }
  ```
