# GraphQL

## A query language for your API

<Notes>
  I think of graphql as a similar tool as
  typescript. It allows us to encode information
  about our code (possibilities, constraints) in a
  way that the computer understands. By spending
  more time up front defining our application's
  behavior, we get a bunch of cool stuff.

## GraphQL is a specification, not an implementation

<Notes>
  The example today will be in Javascript, but
  there are graphql implementations in most
  languages. Javascript is the most common though.
